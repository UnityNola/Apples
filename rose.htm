<pre>Everything is Rosy 
Since I found my Rosie 
With a girl like Rosie, 
how could I be blue? 
Hand in hand we'll mosie 
Me and little Rosie 
We will be so cozy, 
by a fire build for two. 
Oh, I once heard a poem that goes: 
A rose, is a rose, is a rose 
But I don't agree 
take it from me 
There's one rose sweeter 
than any that grows! 
And that's my Rosie 
I'm so glad she chose me! 
Life is one sweet beautiful song 
to me 
Everything is Hugo
I will go where you go 
With a boy like Hugo 
how could I be blue?
We will be so cozy 
Just like Al and Rosie 
But we're gonna mosy
on a hot rod built for two. 
And that's my Rosie 
(Gee how delighted we'll be!) 
I'm so glad she chose me 
(When you are cozy with me)
Life is one sweet beautiful song, 
When love is right then, 
what could be wrong? 
Life is one sweet beautiful song 
to me-eeee-ee</pre>
